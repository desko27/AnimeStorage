		1. take string
		2. delete fansub if was found (it's at the beginning)
		3. (get final position) look for first chapter coincidence if found (from left, which means the last coincidence)
					maybe it's possible to use the returned string position on get-chapter regex
		4. (get final position) look for first "[" enclosure, use end of string otherwise
		5. clean up key words like opening and ending
		6. delete edge trash like spaces and symbols


** (last) means last coincidence.
