AnimeStorage
============

	Still in progress... Alpha should be available in a few months.

Who is this app for?
---------------------

 * Do you download tons of Anime and are obsessed with keeping them all well organized into your drives?
 * Are you tired of manually renaming and moving your recent downloaded anime just to fit your folders structure?
 * Did you forget which was that episode you stored yesterday in its folder to see it later?
 * Do you hate navigating through all those Windows folders to reach the episodes you want to see?
 * Would you love having all your Anime related data like personal rating, genres, or fansub versions, in one single place?

If you answered yes to one of those questions, then this app is for you.
